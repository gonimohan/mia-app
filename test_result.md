- Step 2: Enhanced Data Integration Tab (API Key Management)
- Step 3: RAG-Powered Chatbot
- Step 4: File Upload & Reporting Enhancements  
- Step 5: Backend Agent Enhancements
- Step 6: Final Testing & Deployment

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Created `.env` files for both frontend and backend
   - Configured Supabase authentication and database
   - Set up API keys for market intelligence data sources

2. **Enhanced Backend (Step 5 - Partially Complete)**
   - ✅ Enhanced FastAPI server with comprehensive endpoints
   - ✅ File upload and processing capabilities (.csv, .xlsx, .pdf, .txt)
   - ✅ AI-powered analysis with Google Gemini integration
   - ✅ Data source management with full CRUD operations
   - ✅ Supabase integration for user authentication
   - ✅ Report generation and download functionality
   - ✅ Enhanced chat endpoints for RAG functionality

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Step 2: Enhanced Data Integration Tab** (Next: Convert to tabular view)

- **Step 4: File Upload & Reporting** (Backend ready, frontend components needed)

### ❌ Todo
- Frontend file upload components
- Enhanced API key management table view
- RAG chat interface improvements
- Report generation UI
- Comprehensive testing

## Services Status
- ✅ Backend: Running on port 8000
- ✅ Frontend: Running on port 3000  
- ✅ MongoDB: Running
- ✅ Supabase: Configured and connected

## Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced API key management table view
2. Add file upload UI components
3. Enhance chat interface with RAG capabilities
4. Add report generation and download UI
5. Comprehensive integration testing

## Testing Protocol
### Backend API Testing Results
- ✅ Basic Health Checks: Root and health endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Authentication System: Protected endpoints require authentication as expected
- ✅ Enhanced Chat API: Chat endpoint working with proper response format
- ✅ Error Handling: Proper error responses for invalid requests
- ✅ Agent Status & KPI Endpoints: Working correctly
- ✅ Agent Sync: Working correctly
- ⚠️ File Upload Functionality: Implemented but requires authentication for testing
- ⚠️ Data Source Management: Implemented but requires authentication for testing
- ⚠️ Analysis and Reporting: Implemented but requires authentication for testing
