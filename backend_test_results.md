## Agent Communication
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Created comprehensive backend test script to test all API endpoints"
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Successfully tested non-authenticated endpoints. Basic health checks, chat API, error handling, agent status, KPI endpoints, and agent sync are working correctly. Authentication-protected endpoints (file upload, data source management, analysis and reporting) are implemented but require valid user credentials for full testing."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "To complete testing of authenticated endpoints, we need to either: 1) Create a valid Supabase user account, or 2) Modify the backend to bypass authentication for testing purposes."
